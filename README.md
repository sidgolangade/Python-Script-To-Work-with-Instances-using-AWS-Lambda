# Python-Script-To-Work-with-Instances-using-AWS-Lambda

# Description
This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that demonstrate how to work with EC2 instances using AWS Lambda functions. These scripts utilize the power of AWS Lambda and the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate tasks related to AWS Seervices such as EC2 instance management. The scripts cover various operations, such as describing instances, starting instances, stopping instances, and more. 

# Key Highlights

## Automation: 
These scripts enable you to automate common tasks associated with EC2 instance management, reducing manual effort and increasing operational efficiency.
## Serverless Architecture: 
The scripts are designed to be executed as AWS Lambda functions, leveraging the serverless capabilities of AWS for cost-effective and scalable execution.
## Boto3 Integration: 
The scripts utilize the Boto3 library, which is the AWS SDK for Python. Boto3 simplifies the interaction with AWS services, providing a high-level API for easy integration with EC2 instances.
## Fine-Grained Control: 
Each script focuses on a specific operation, allowing you to choose and adapt the functionalities that align with your requirements.
## Customization: 
The scripts can be extended and modified to suit your specific use cases, whether it's integrating with other AWS services or adding additional logic.
